        <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">Ideal for high-precision designs, unusual mating geometries, and tolerance-critical jointsâ€”especially where CAD alone canâ€™t reveal real-world friction, misalignment, or deformation.</p>

            <h3>1. Real Fit â†’ Real Insight</h3>
            <p>We produce parts that replicate exact geometry, material behavior, and finishâ€”so you can check fit, feel, and friction directly, not hypothetically.</p>

            <h3>2. Feedback Into Design</h3>
            <p>Our findings donâ€™t stop at "it works" or "it doesnâ€™t." Each prototype comes with dimensional verification, annotated risk zones, and practical design suggestions.</p>

            <h3>3. Confidence to Scale</h3>
            <p>Prototypes arenâ€™t just samplesâ€”theyâ€™re a stress test. We use them to prove repeatability, validate mating interfaces, and reduce launch friction for scaling to production.</p>
