        <h2>Why Parts Failâ€”Even When Drawings Are "Perfect"</h2>
        <p>
          A CMM report shows green across the board. The CAD model passes every check. But on the lineâ€”joints jam, slip, or crack.
        </p>
        <p>
          This gap between drawing and reality is where millions are lost in rework, downtime, and warranty claims. It's caused by dynamic geometry interactionsâ€”slight chamfer mismatches, poor contact angles, or unintended stress pathsâ€”that static checks can't see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our <strong>Assembly Process Audit</strong> is engineered to bridge that gap and expose the geometric root cause of failure before it costs you.

        <p style="text-align: center; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">
          This service is critical for: <strong>Production Line Managers</strong> battling recurring jams, <strong>Design Teams</strong> launching a new product, and <strong>Quality Engineers</strong> investigating costly field failures.

            <h3>1. Geometric Risk Zones</h3>
            <p>
              We analyze mating paths to spot interference areas, high-friction zones, and chamfer-induced misalignment risksâ€”often missed by tolerance checks alone.

            <h3>2. Stress Path Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              Our audits simulate insertion, loading, and vibration forces across joint geometryâ€”revealing unintended tilt, contact loss, and torque-to-slippage transitions.

            <h3>3. Failure Mode Report</h3>
            <p>
              Every audit includes a visual report with red-flag zones, annotated overlays, and targeted suggestionsâ€”so you donâ€™t just see the problem, you know how to fix it.

          <details>
            <summary>How is this different from a standard design review?</summary>
            <p>A standard review checks if a part meets drawing dimensions. Our audit simulates how that part <strong>behaves</strong> in your assembly, identifying dynamic failures (like jamming or slipping) that static checks cannot predict.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Is this an on-site or remote service?</summary>
            <p>Both. We typically begin with a remote audit based on your drawings and data. If the issue is complex, an on-site review of the physical assembly line can be arranged to gather real-world data.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details>
            <summary>What is the final deliverable?</summary>
            <p>You will receive a detailed PDF report featuring visual overlays of risk zones, a root cause analysis for each potential failure mode, and actionable design or process recommendations to fix them.</p>
          </details>
          
          <details>
            <summary>What data do you need from us to start?</summary>
            <p>To start, we need the 2D/3D CAD files of the problematic joint, information on materials and coatings, and a brief description of the failure you are observing. Video of the failure is often very helpful.</p>
