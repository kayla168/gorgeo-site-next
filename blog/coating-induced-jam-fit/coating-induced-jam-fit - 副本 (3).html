      <p class="lead-paragraph">
        This report dissects a <strong>coating-induced fit jam</strong>, where a powder-coated fit passed CAD review but jammed during press-fit assembly. 
        Despite using the same vendor and specifications, a coating layer not accounted for in the original drawing created a critical interference, 
        revealing a common blind spot between design intent and real-world manufacturing.
      </p>

      <section id="problem">
        <h2>The Problem: A "Perfect" Fit That Failed</h2>
        <blockquote>“Previous batches worked fine. This one just jammed—same vendor, same coating, same CAD.”</blockquote>
        <p>
          This was the report from our client. A powder-coated interference sleeve, which had passed all CAD and spec validations, 
          was causing line stoppages during assembly. Initial measurements showed that both tolerance and coating thickness were within specification. 
          The root cause was more subtle: the CAD modeled a bare metal fit, completely ignoring the build-up from the powder coating process.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="diagnosis">
        <h2>Diagnosis: The Unmodeled Coating Layer</h2>
        <p>
          Our analysis pinpointed the issue as a classic case of unmodeled finishes. 
          The powder coating added approximately 0.05mm of thickness per side. While seemingly minor, 
          this addition completely consumed the designed clearance, creating a -0.08mm jam fit that made assembly impossible.
        </p>

          <figcaption>TRAP #1: The original CAD showed a working fit, but the real-world coating build-up created a 0.08mm interference.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This interference forced the insertion pin onto an eccentric path, creating a "Jam Zone" where excess coating accumulated. 
          Stress concentration in the "Bite Zone" led to galling and powder residue build-up. 
          Over repeated cycles, edge flaking became evident, further worsening the interference and reducing long-term reliability.

        <h2>Solution: 3 Actionable Engineering Fixes</h2>
        <div class="callout-box">
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Design Fix:</strong> Add a <strong>0.5mm / 30° chamfer</strong> at the insertion lead. This guided entry prevents misalignment and initial bite.</li>
            <li><strong>Process Fix:</strong> <strong>Mask the coating</strong> near critical fit zones during the powder-coating process, or redesign the part's tolerance to accommodate the +0.1mm stack-up.</li>
            <li><strong>Assembly Fix:</strong> Replace mallet-driven press-fitting with <strong>self-guided slide-in techniques</strong> to ensure concentricity and avoid side-loading.</li>

        <h2>Key Takeaways for Design Teams</h2>
        <p>
          This case highlights a critical disconnect between design and manufacturing. 
          Post-processing like coating and plating must be treated as a key feature in the design phase, not an afterthought. 
          To prevent <strong>coating-induced fit jams</strong>, engineering teams must proactively integrate these variables early.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you log coating-related fit failures in your QA path?</li>
          <li>Is there a standard communication interface between surface-treatment vendors and your design teams?</li>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>Why does a part that passes CAD review still jam during assembly?</h3>
        <p>
          Because post-processing steps like powder coating aren’t modeled in CAD. Even a thin layer of 0.05mm per side can eliminate clearance and create significant interference. 
          This is especially critical in high-speed intralogistics systems, where small deviations lead to large-scale downtime.
        </p>
        <h3>How can you prevent coating-induced fit failures?</h3>
        <p>
          By combining design fixes (chamfers), process controls (masking or tolerance redesign), 
          and improved assembly practices (guided insertion). Many OEMs in conveyor and ASRS industries have avoided costly shutdowns by implementing these measures.
