        <h1>Our Process: From Drawing to Guaranteed Fit</h1>
        <p>We don't just manufacture parts; we engineer reliability. This is our 3-phase process for dissecting your geometry, validating the solution, and delivering production parts that are guaranteed to fit and function. No guesswork. Just geometry.</p>

            <h3>Phase 1: Free Geometry Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>Our work begins with a digital dissection of your design. You upload a drawing, and our engineers perform a no-cost root cause analysis‚Äîinvestigating tolerance stack-up, coating interference, and assembly path risks that standard reviews often miss.</p>

            <h3>Phase 2: Structural Prototyping</h3>
            <p>A theory is not a solution. We machine fit-validation prototypes engineered for real-world testing. These aren't show pieces; they are structural tools used to uncover fit, force, and load anomalies before you commit to production.</p>

            <summary>What is your ‚ÄúFit-Function Guarantee‚Äù?</summary>
            <p>This is our core promise. Most suppliers guarantee their parts match the dimensions on your drawing. We go a step further. We guarantee our parts will achieve the intended function in your assembly. If a part is dimensionally "correct" but still jams, vibrates loose, or fails to assemble smoothly due to an overlooked geometric factor, we consider it our failure‚Äînot yours.

          <details>
            <summary>How do you protect my intellectual property (IP)?</summary>
            <p>We honor NDAs and confidentiality by default. Your drawings are used solely for diagnosis and production. We can sign your NDA on request.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do you sign NDAs or confidentiality agreements?</summary>
            <p>Yes, we regularly work under client-provided NDAs. We also have our own standard NDA template ready for immediate execution if you prefer.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What‚Äôs the difference between a sample and a prototype?</summary>
            <p><strong>Samples</strong> show general workmanship; our <strong>structural prototypes</strong> are custom-machined from your drawing to validate your exact geometry under real-world loads and fits.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How accurate are your prototypes vs. final parts?</summary>
            <p>Our prototypes are manufactured using the same precision CNC processes as production parts. Critical dimensions are held within ¬±0.01‚ÄØmm so you can rely on them for functional testing.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What if my design needs to change after Phase 2?</summary>
            <p>This is a normal part of the engineering process. Our goal in Phase 2 is to find problems. If a prototype reveals a necessary design improvement, we don't see it as a setback‚Äîwe see it as a success. Our team will provide engineering feedback to help you revise the geometry. We are your partners in iteration, not just a machine shop.</p>
