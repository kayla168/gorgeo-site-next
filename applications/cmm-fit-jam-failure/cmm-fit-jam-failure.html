        <p class="lead-paragraph">
          Everything was green ‚Äî the drawings, the tolerances, the inspection. But parts still jammed during final assembly. Here's what really went wrong, and how we fixed it without loosening a single spec.
        </p>

        <section id="section1">
          <h2>The Assembly Floor: CMM All Green, But Still Jamming Like a Misfit</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Part dimensions?</strong> In spec.</li>
            <li><strong>CMM reports?</strong> All green.</li>
            <li><strong>Fit tolerance?</strong> H7/g6, textbook perfect.</li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            Three batches of parts, one mold set, two trained operators, and five straight jamming failures.  
            The fastener stopped halfway in. Couldn't push, couldn't tap. One dowel pin snapped under hammering.
          </blockquote>
          <p>Customer‚Äôs first suspicion? "Is your fastener out of tolerance?" But after digging into inspection sheets, tolerance charts, and assembly videos ‚Äî the truth came out:  
          <strong>It wasn‚Äôt about size. It was a geometric misalignment across three subtle design features.</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section id="section2">
          <h2>The Myth: "If It's In Tolerance, It Should Fit"</h2>
          <p>This failure was particularly tricky because everything passed traditional inspection.  
          The customer used a standard H7/g6 shaft-hole fit. Drawings were correct. The machining quality was consistent.  
          CMM reports showed less than ¬±0.01 mm deviation.</p>
          <p>And yet, it jammed. Why? Because <strong>assembly is not just dimensional ‚Äî it‚Äôs behavioral.</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Can the operator align easily at the start?</li>
            <li>Is there a lead-in geometry that helps positioning?</li>
            <li>Are there any traps for angular misalignment?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It‚Äôs like inserting a key into a lock. Even if the teeth match, if you start at the wrong angle ‚Äî it sticks.  
          We ran a full geometry-behavior simulation. The results were startling.</p>

          <h2>Root Cause: A Trio of Tiny Traps Working Together</h2>
          <h3>‚ù∂ Lead-In Angle: Too Short, Too Steep</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The hole had a shallow 0.3 mm chamfer ‚Äî barely noticeable</li>
            <li>The mating shaft had only a 0.2√ó45¬∞ chamfer</li>
            <li>Result: zero auto-centering effect; operator had no forgiveness</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>‚ù∑ Contact Face Angle: The Stress-Wedge Effect</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A 38¬∞ mating surface created lateral stress during insertion</li>
            <li>The fastener tilted easily and jammed along the side wall</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>‚ù∏ Step Geometry: No Relief, Hard Collision</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A sharp shoulder at the shaft-step hit a square internal step</li>
            <li>Operator mistook it for full insertion ‚Äî but it was a false fit</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each of these issues alone might not jam. But together, they created a perfect trap.</p>

          <h2>The Fix: Not Bigger Gaps, But Smarter Geometry</h2>
          <h3>‚úÖ Lead-In Redesign: Longer + Rounded</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Extended hole chamfer from 0.3 mm to 1.2 mm with R0.5 fillet</li>
            <li>Result: smooth auto-alignment, less sensitivity to operator angle</li>

          <h3>‚úÖ Contact Angle Tuning: From 38¬∞ to 25¬∞ + Dual-Stage Entry</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduced sliding force vectors during insertion</li>
            <li>Added a two-stage entry to absorb misalignment</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>‚úÖ Step Transition: Chamfer + Visual Guide Groove</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Added a 0.5√ó45¬∞ chamfer at the shoulder</li>
            <li>Inserted a shallow groove to help operators verify seating</li>

          <h2>Final Thoughts: Precision Alone Doesn't Ensure Performance</h2>
          <p>This case is a clear reminder: H7/g6, ¬±0.01 mm ‚Äî these are starting points, not guarantees of success.  
          True fit happens in dynamic, multi-angle, real-world assembly conditions.</p>

            <li>Simulate multi-factor assembly behavior</li>
